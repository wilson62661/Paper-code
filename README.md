## Usage Instructions

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Run the script to preprocess the dataset and split it into training and testing sets.`Fragment.py`

### 2.Train RF Model
Using Google Colab run the script to preprocess the dataset and split it into training and testing sets.`HELM.ipynb`

### 3. Convert
Using Google Colab run the script to convert the RF modelâ€™s decision boundaries into executable rules for the data plane.`HELM_convert_RF_to_table_entries.ipynb`
